    <p class="section-appear">
      I stood right in front of you, but you never saw me.<br>
      I spoke my heart, but you didn’t hear it.<br><br>
      You were too busy with your life, to see mine crumbling.<br>
      I was always there, waiting… but you never looked.<br><br>
      The hardest part was pretending everything was fine when inside, I was breaking.<br>
      You were my everything, but I was nothing to you.<br><br>
      I waited and waited, hoping one day you’d notice.<br>
      But I was invisible. A shadow in the background of your life.
