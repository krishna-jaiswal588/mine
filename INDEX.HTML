      Even when I said nothing, my heart was full of words for you.<br>
      I stayed. I cared. I never stopped loving you.<br><br>
      You were my first thought every morning, and my last every night.<br>
      I didn’t ask for anything… just for you to feel what I couldn’t say.<br>
      My love was silent, but it was screaming inside me.<br><br>
      All these years, I’ve waited for the moment you’d see the truth in my eyes.<br>
      The truth that I never walked away, never gave up — I stayed because I loved you.<br><br>
      But you never looked back. And still, I remained.<br><br>
      I waited through every storm, every silence — believing that one day, you’d hear my heart.<br>
      But you never heard it. Instead, you walked away.<br><br>
      And now, I’m left with only these words — words I can’t say to you anymore.
