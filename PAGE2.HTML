      I thought you'd see me one day — the way I saw you every day.<br>
      But time kept moving, and you never looked back.<br><br>
      Every message you didn’t send… every moment you didn’t notice — I noticed.<br>
      I kept believing you’d turn around.<br>
      I was always there, quietly holding on while pretending I wasn’t hurting.<br><br>
      But the waiting started to feel endless. The silence, suffocating.<br>
      I waited for a call that never came, a gesture that never happened.<br><br>
      And I began to wonder — does love require silence? Or does it demand to be heard?<br><br>
      I waited for you to love me back in the way I needed.<br>
      But every time I waited, my heart broke a little more.<br><br>
      And now, I’m just exhausted. I still love you, but I can’t keep waiting.
