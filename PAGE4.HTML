      I gave everything I had, but it was never enough.<br>
      I waited, I hoped, I loved — but it still feels like I’m standing alone.<br><br>
      My heart still holds on, even when my soul feels tired.<br>
      I never wanted to lose you — not then, not now, not ever.<br><br>
      But it’s getting harder to breathe through the silence.<br>
      I keep carrying this love like it’s all I have left.<br><br>
      I'm not ready to let go. I don't think I ever will.<br>
      I just wish… you could see how much this is hurting me.<br><br>
      I’m tired — not of loving you, but of feeling like I’m the only one who does.
